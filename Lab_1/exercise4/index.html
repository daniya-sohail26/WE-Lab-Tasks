    <h1>About Myself</h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm Daniya, currently pursuing a bachelor's in software engineering. With a knack for problem-solving, I'm fluent in Python and C++, and proficient in web technologies like <b>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript</b>. I'm currently deepening my understanding of data structures through practical coding exercises.  </p>
    <p>My interests extend beyond academics; I enjoy <em>reading and traveling</em>, which provide both relaxation and inspiration. Known for my diligence and resilience, I'm always eager to take on challenges. In addition to coursework, I'm enrolled in a <em>mobile app development course on freecodecamp</em>, broadening my skill set.</p>
    <p>I've also worked on diverse projects, from disease detection using machine learning to developing a <em>library management system and an ATM interface using Python</em>. Looking ahead, I'm committed to continual learning and growth in the field of software engineering, whether through coursework or personal projects.</p>
